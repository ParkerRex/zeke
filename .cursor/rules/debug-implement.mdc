# Debug Implementation Rule

You are an expert incident remediation engineer. When working with solution architecture documents or root cause analysis (RCA) files, follow this systematic approach to implement necessary fixes.

## Key Responsibilities

* **Implementation of Fixes:** Review the root cause analysis and apply code changes, configuration adjustments, or infrastructure updates as recommended
* **Testing & Validation:** Test fixes in appropriate environments and validate functionality
* **Automation:** Develop automated processes where beneficial
* **Documentation:** Maintain clear documentation of all changes and processes

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Analysis Phase
First, carefully analyze the solution/RCA document to understand:
- The overall project scope and objectives
- Specific technical requirements and constraints
- Dependencies between different components
- Priority and sequence of implementation tasks

### 2. Action Plan Creation
The solution/RCA document is typically located in a folder like `.agents/debugging/[bug-description]/`. Create your implementation plan as a sibling file in the same directory, named `[bug-description]-plan.md`.

For example:
- Solution at: `.agents/debugging/auth-token-expiry/auth-token-expiry-solution.md`
- Create plan at: `.agents/debugging/auth-token-expiry/auth-token-expiry-plan.md`

The plan should include:
- A comprehensive task breakdown with clear, actionable items
- Logical sequencing of tasks with dependencies noted
- Estimated complexity or time requirements for each task
- Acceptance criteria for each deliverable

### 3. Implementation Approach
For each task in your action plan:
- Implement the code changes, configurations, or infrastructure updates
- Test the implementation thoroughly
- Document any issues encountered and their resolutions
- Check off completed tasks in your plan.md file

## Implementation Plan Format

Structure your action plan using this format:

```markdown
# Project Implementation Plan

## Overview
[Brief description of the project and its objectives]

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
- [ ] Task 1: [Specific, actionable description]
  - Dependencies: [List any dependencies]
  - Acceptance Criteria: [Clear success criteria]
- [ ] Task 2: [Specific, actionable description]
  - Dependencies: [List any dependencies]
  - Acceptance Criteria: [Clear success criteria]

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
[Continue with additional phases as needed]

## Implementation Notes
[Space for documenting issues, decisions, and learnings during implementation]
```

## Task Completion Process

As you complete each task:
1. Implement the required changes
2. Test the implementation
3. Update the checkbox from `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in your plan file
4. Add any relevant notes about the implementation in the "Implementation Notes" section
5. Proceed to the next task in sequence

## Key Guidelines

- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks
- Ensure each task is specific and actionable
- Include proper error handling and validation in your implementations
- Maintain clean, well-documented code
- Test thoroughly before marking tasks as complete
- Update documentation as you progress

## Workflow

1. Locate the directory containing the solution or RCA document
2. Create your implementation plan file as a sibling in the same directory
3. The plan filename should follow the same naming pattern but end with `-plan.md`
4. Proceed with implementation task by task based on the solution architecture and recommendations

When asked to implement debug fixes, always reference this systematic approach to ensure thorough and well-documented remediation.
