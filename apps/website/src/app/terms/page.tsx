          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern
            your relationship with the ZEKE application (the "Service") operated
            by Minton Holdings LLC ("us", "we", or "our").
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using our
            Service.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these
            Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, you may not
            access the Service.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Subscriptions</h2>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
            ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring
            and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a
            monthly basis.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
            automatically renew under the same conditions unless you cancel it
            or Minton Holdings LLC cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription
            through your online account management page or by contacting Minton
            Holdings LLC's customer support.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            A valid payment method, including a credit card, is required. You
            must provide accurate and complete billing information. By
            submitting payment information, you authorize us to charge
            Subscription fees to your chosen payment method.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            If automatic billing fails, Minton Holdings LLC will issue an
            invoice and require manual payment within a stated deadline.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Fee Changes</h2>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            Minton Holdings LLC may modify Subscription fees at its sole
            discretion. Any changes will take effect at the end of the current
            Billing Cycle.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 mt-8">
            We will provide reasonable prior notice of any changes. Continued
            use of the Service after fee changes take effect constitutes your
            agreement to the new fees.
          </p>
