# ZEKE — Give everyone pro‑level research & applied‑AI skills

## Executive summary (outcomes first)

- **Go from 10 hours → 5 minutes**: Zeke turns long podcasts, papers, videos, and posts into a verified, role‑aware brief with receipts.
- **Find what matters you’d never have time to find**: It sifts across sources you’d only reach if you had a full‑time researcher.
- **Apply it to your business right away**: Load your goals and SOPs (or use ours). Zeke turns insights into ready‑to‑use plans, prompts, briefs, and content.
- **Create from research, not from a blank page**: Publish cited content (threads, posts, emails, briefs) directly from the findings—no AI slop.

**One‑liner:**

**Zeke makes research effortless—turn sprawling content into verified insights and ready‑to‑use outputs, fast.**

**Two‑liner:**

**Discover the signal across podcasts, papers, videos, and posts. Then instantly apply it to your goals and SOPs to produce briefs, plans, and content—grounded by receipts.**

**Elevator (to a friend):**

“Zeke is the ‘easy button’ for AI research. Paste a link. It pulls out what matters, shows you proof, and turns it into the exact doc or content you need for your work. Minutes, not days.”

---

## Why people use Zeke (plain‑speak)

- **Sifts through content you couldn’t realistically get to** (unless you did research full‑time).
- **Finds the juiciest bits for you**—claims, numbers, demos, contradictions, trends.
- **Applies instantly to your business**—load goals & SOPs (or grab our templates) and get **playbooks** you can run today.

## Founder story (why we’re building it)

> “I was always hunting for the edge: 10 YouTube videos a week, consulting to pay bills, building a community of engineers just to keep up. It was impossible to track everything, so I got good at defining SOPs and leveraging AI. I sold automation as a service and built agents for people.
>
>
> Now I’m automating the thing I had to do manually—**turning chaos into playbooks** so any business can actually leverage this stuff.”

## Objections and simple answers

**“I’ll miss the nuance if I don’t watch/listen/read all of it.”**

You choose depth: skim a 10‑bullet brief → jump into chapter highlights → open the exact timestamp or paragraph. **Everything is indexed and cited** so you can verify, fast.

**“AI makes things up.”**

We anchor each claim to a **source snippet or timestamp**. If something is uncertain, we **flag it**. No black‑box summaries.

**“I can skim on 2x speed.”**

Sure. Zeke adds what skimming can’t: **cross‑source synthesis**, **relevance to your goal**, and **instant application** into your SOPs and outputs.

**“My team already has tools.”**

Keep them. Zeke sits on top: **ingest → analyze → apply → create**. It’s the missing layer that **connects research to outcomes**.

---

## The everyday problems we eradicate (mass‑appeal)

- “This episode is 10 hours… where are the **two minutes** that matter to me?”
- “Everyone’s posting ‘breakthroughs’. **Which ones move my KPI**?”
- “I found five papers, but **what’s actually novel** and **can we replicate it**?”
- “I need a PRD/brief/email **today**, but I’m still swimming in tabs.”
- “Marketing wants content—but **no AI slop** and **show your sources**.”

---

## Before/After transformations (relatable, practical)

### A) YouTube (long interviews, product demos, explainers)

**Before (real life):**

- You guess what’s important.
- You wonder, “Did they say something **new**? Was there a **demo** I should see?”
- You try to judge **controversy**, **second‑order effects**, **what comments are referencing**, and **how it’s performing vs their usual**—by hand.
- **Time spent: hours.**

**After (Zeke):**

- **Instant brief**: 6–10 bullets “Why it matters,” one‑paragraph executive summary.
- **Chapter map with jump‑links**: segment titles, claims, quotes, and **timestamps**.
- **“What’s new?”** detector: unheard‑of claims and novel demos flagged.
- **Heat signals**: day‑1 performance vs channel median, spikes, velocity.
- **Comment intelligence**: top themes, what timestamps are referenced, sentiment shifts.
- **Apply now**: pick “Product brief,” “Campaign angle,” or “Experiment plan”—Zeke drafts it **with citations**.

    **Time spent: minutes.**


### B) Podcasts (marathon episodes, roundtables)

**Before:**

- 2–4 hours per episode. You forget who claimed what. You can’t cite anything cleanly.
- Actionables get lost in a sea of conversation.

**After (Zeke):**

- **Speaker‑aware outline** with pull‑quotes and positions (“Alice argues X, Bob counters Y”).
- **Evidence ledger**: claims linked to sources; uncertain items flagged.
- **Role‑aware takeaways**: “If you’re Growth / PM / Research, here’s what to do.”
- **One‑click outputs**: outreach email draft, meeting brief, experiment play.

    **Time saved:** 90–95%.


### C) Research papers (dense PDFs, arXiv firehose)

**Before:**

- You skim abstract + conclusion and hope you caught the point.
- Hard to tell **novelty vs incremental**, **compute cost**, **dataset quirks**, **reproducibility**, or **SOTA deltas**.

**After (Zeke):**

- **Novelty scanner**: what’s truly new, what it replaces, how it compares to SOTA **with extracted tables**.
- **Replication readiness**: code? data? compute estimate? hidden caveats surfaced.
- **Decision snapshot**: “Should we try this?” with expected effort/impact and risks.
- **Auto‑trend linkage**: connects to related papers, labs, benchmarks; shows adoption signals.
- **Apply**: spinning up a **mini‑replication plan** or **internal tech brief** with citations.

    **Time saved:** hours per paper → minutes.

## How Zeke works (without jargon)

1. **Ingest** anything: podcasts, YouTube, papers, posts, tweets, docs.
2. **Analyze** for you: pull what matters, link to proof, and rate heat/novelty.
3. **Apply** to your goals/SOPs: turn insights into plans, prompts, briefs.
4. **Create** outputs: memos, threads, posts, emails—**cited** and on‑brand.

> We’re not selling a “copilot.” That’s just a feature.
>
>
> We’re selling **outcomes**: clarity, speed, and publish‑ready work.

## Product pillars

1. **Discover insights** — Aggregate, dedupe, and highlight the signal (with receipts).
2. **Applied AI** — Align everything to your goals and SOPs; generate runnable plays.
3. **Create from research** — Ship on‑brand, cited content and docs—no AI slop.

---

## Roadmap (phases you can pitch)

### Phase 1 — Ingestion & Analysis (Now)

- Multi‑source ingestion across media.
- Executive briefs, “Why it matters,” chapter maps, comment intelligence.
- Reliability guardrails (citations, timestamps, source snippets).
- Heat/novelty scoring; near‑duplicate clustering across sources.

### Phase 2 — Playbooks (Next)

- Load your **goals** & **SOPs** (or use templates).
- One‑click **Apply**: PRDs, experiment plans, campaign angles, outreach, enablement.
- Team playbook library: reuse what works; track outcomes.

### Phase 3 — Create from Research (After)

- Turn findings into **threads, posts, emails, briefs, decks** with citations.
- Publish pipelines: push to CMS, newsletter, social schedulers, **Canva** or similar for design.
- “No AI slop” enforcement: show sources inline; style‑guide & tone controls.

---

## Strategic benefits to highlight

- **Operational efficiency**: compress research cycles by 80–95%.
- **Productivity per person**: fewer tabs, more shipped artifacts.
- **Higher output**: consistent, cited content that builds trust and SEO.
- **Better decisions**: less gut‑feel, more proof‑backed action.

---

## Socratic pitch (for investors, partners, press)

**What are we building and for whom?**

A research engine for operators, founders, marketers, PMs—**anyone who needs answers and outcomes, not tabs**.

**Why hasn’t this been done?**

Cross‑media ingestion + trustworthy evidence + SOP‑aligned application in one flow is hard. Most tools stop at summaries or stop at chat.

**Why is it hard?**

You need extraction that respects context, verifiable grounding, relevance to *each user’s* job, and UX that makes **apply → create** trivial.

**Why is this an opportunity now?**

AI cycles are weekly; attention is scarce. Teams that turn research into action the fastest win. **Canva made design easy; Zeke makes research & application easy.**

## BIG thinking — what we can unlock with our data

**1) Trend & Research Graph**

- Entity/claim graph across people, labs, models, datasets, benchmarks, companies.
- **Auto‑trends**: “RAG + tools papers up 180% QoQ; top labs converging on X; best open‑source reps.”
- Diffusion of ideas: who cites whom, where ideas jump from papers → podcasts → products.

**2) Hype vs Reality index**

- Score announcements; track follow‑through (code, benchmarks, adoption).
- **Contradiction heatmap**: show where sources disagree and why.

**3) Longitudinal benchmarking**

- Harvest eval tables from papers; standardize and chart SOTA over time.
- Alerts when a method relevant to your SOP moves the needle.

**4) Applied automation**

- From a finding, generate a **runnable experiment** (data, prompts, evals).
- Integrate with notebooks/CI to run smoke tests and log results.

**5) Creator & GTM factory**

- From one research story: **thread + LinkedIn + blog outline + enablement email**—all cited.
- Weekly role‑based briefings for execs, product, sales, research.

**6) Trust & governance**

- Provenance badges on every artifact (sources, timestamps, model version).
- Team‑level policies (e.g., “no publish without two sources”).

**7) Platform**

- API/SDK to embed Zeke in other products.
- Browser/inbox sidecar to summarize & apply in‑context.
- Marketplace for community playbooks (industry‑specific SOPs).
